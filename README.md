# 🖋️ File Read & Write + Error Handling Challenge

This is a simple Python program that:

-  Reads a text file provided by the user  
-  Handles errors if the file doesn't exist or can't be read  
-  Adds **line numbers** to each line of the file  
-  Writes the modified content to a **new output file**
